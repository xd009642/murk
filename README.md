# murk

Murk aims to learn lessons from wrk and wrk2 as well as fulfilling some of my
own needs. Mainly:

1. Being able to use the scripts to extract values from responses and add to
extra HdrHistograms
2. Future extensibility to gRPC
3. Cycle through different request bodies for a more realistic workload
